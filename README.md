README
======

[Debian](http:www.debian.org) packages, maintains and distributes some
works that are developed using GitHub.  This account was created to
facilitate push/pull interactions with the upstream developers of
such projects.  If you maintain such a package, please feel free to
join this group and mirror it here.

This account is not intended to serve as the canonical (specified with
Vcs-* fields of debian/control) location for corresponding Debian
source packages.  Most often such repositories should be made
available on the Debian project's public forge
[Alioth](http:git.debian.org) to guarantee
[autonomy](http://autonomo.us/2008/07/franklin-street-statement).

Tips
----

You might find following tools available from Debian useful for
your interaction with github

 [github-backup](http://guthub.com/joeyh/github-backup)
   Back up everything GitHub publishes about the repository
   (forks, issues, comments, wikis, milestones, pull requests)

Acknowledgments
---------------

Many thanks to the GitHub admins for their prompt action to release the
previous (unused) "Debian" account.

Disclaimers

This account is not an endorsement of GitHub by Debian.
