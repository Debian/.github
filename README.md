README
======

[Debian](http:www.debian.org) packages, maintains and distributes many
projects developed using GitHub.  This account was created to facilitate
push/pull interactions with the upstream developers of such projects.  If
you maintain a package whose upstream developers use GitHub, please feel
free to join this group and mirror such project here.

This account is not intended to serve as the canonical (specified with
Vcs-* fields of debian/control) location for corresponding Debian
source packages.  Most often such repositories should be made
available on the Debian project's public forge
[Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org) to guarantee
[autonomy](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002034726/http://autonomo.us/2008/07/franklin-street-statement/).

Acknowledgments
---------------

Many thanks to the GitHub admins for their prompt action to release the
previous (unused) "Debian" account.


Disclaimers
-----------

This GitHub organization is not an endorsement of GitHub by Debian.
Debian does not maintain or distribute the GitHub engine codebase
because it is not available under free and open-source license (see
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29) for a
list of available free and open-source alternatives).  Moreover, this
GitHub organization is not an official part of the Debian project.  It
is maintained by individual Debian developers (signed below) with the
sole purpose of being useful.
