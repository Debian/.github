======

Debian packages some works that are developped on GitHub, and sometimes uses
Git to manage the corresponding Debian source package, most often on our forge,
[Alioth](http:git.debian.org).

This account was created facilitate push/pull interactions with the maintainers
of these works that we package and redistribute.  If you maintain such a
package, please feel free to join this group and mirror it here.

Many thanks to the GitHub admins for their prompt action to release the
previous (unused) "Debian" account.

To clarify any misunderstanding in advance, I need to add that this account is
not an endorsement of GitHub by Debian, as GitHub does not redistribute the
source code of its code-sharing infrastructure.  That would be great
contribution to Free software !
